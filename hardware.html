        <h2>Game Developers Don't Need Much</h2>
        <p>When it comes to hardware, game developers do not need much. You can even create a game on a standard laptop<br>
        if you want to. </p>
        <h3>The Main Parts</h3>
        <p>The Video Card</p>
        <p>The video card is what allows the computer to who what you do on the screen or monitor. For game <br>
            development you don't need a high-end video card to do what you want. It is suggested that you look<br>
            for a card with at least 4 gigabytes.
        <p>Processor</p>
           <p>When it comes to processoers people usually prefer some like i5 to i8 processors from Intel.<br>
            Intel is known to have good quality hardware that lasts a long time. i5 is known better for minimal<br>
            use while i8 is considered a more high-end style of processor. Whichever one you decide to go with<br>
            you can make game development work with what you have.</p>
        <p>RAM</p>
            <p>RAM is what stores a lot of your information on your computer. So when developing a lot of your<br>
            your work will be held somewhere when you save the files. The downside is that RAM is limited on<br>
            all devices so it would be better to find a computer with a good amount starting off to maybe save<br>
            yourself some money down the line. Typically 16-32 gigabytes is the preferred amount.</p>
