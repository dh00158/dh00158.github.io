        <h2>Developer Insights</h2>
        <p>Developer insights are articles and forums made by developers for multiple reasons the most popular of those being<br>
        articles about upcoming information in the game or upcoming features to be updated or added to the game. The developerforums<br>
        provide a place for people of the game's community to come together and ask questions to the developers directly.<br>
        There are two main games that stick out to me when it ocmes to how the devlopers interact with their audience and<br>
        those are Warframe and Dead By Daylight</p>
        <h3>Warframe</h3>
        <p>The developers of Warframe at Digital Extremes often open up forums for people to come ask questions about patches<br>
            and updates when they are ready for release. They also listen to player feedback and sometimes implement features or<br>
            tweak existing features according to how players respond.</p>
           <p><a href="https://forums.warframe.com/">Here is a collection of forums.</a>from the direct website of Warframe.</p>
        <h3>Dead By Daylight</h3>
            <p>Dave Richard, the creative director for Dead by Daylight did an interview with gaming news website "Gamereactor"<br>
            and provided some information on the making and inspiration for the game. He explains that to hopefully keep players<br>
            playing they want to keep adding different characters and to update some of the older parts of the game. </p>
            <p>For those that would like to read the full article <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/expanding-inspirations-and-collaborating-an-interview-with-the-dead-by-daylight-developer/">Here</a> is the link.</p>
