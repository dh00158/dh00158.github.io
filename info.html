        <h2>Here is some general and well known information about the development industry.</h2>
        <p>There are many facts about gaming that you could go over but I would like to focus on the early stages of games.</p>

        <div class="column">
            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <p>Video games first began to rise in popularity in and around the 1970s and at a very rapid rate.<br>
            It all started with the game called "Spacewar!" It was a very simplistic game that was developed during 1961 and 1962.<br>
            The 1970s is when more programmers started to make more programming languages and started to make more games.<br>
            This caused a huge increase in video game sales but also a huge incresae in poorly developed games <br>
            because so many people were trying to get games made and dveloped in such quick sucession.</p>
            <h2>Standard Increase</h2>
            <p>Since games were being constntly made and with very little time and development it led to a temporary crash<br>
            in the gaming market. There were also a mass increase in pirated games being sold all around and forcing the <br>
            game developers to increase their standards when it came to development. This ended up leading to the development of <br>
            cartridges and eventually to disks and digital purchasing. This change in marketing and selling allowed companies to <br>
            better regulate their titles and releases because the game had to be verified and published to make it to store shelves.</p>
