        <h2>Game Development Has Many Different Positions</h2>
        <p>Ranging from internal development to marketing and sales game development can require a massive range<br>
            of skills.<br>
            One of the main jobs of game development is creating the game itself so it requires an extensive range<br>
            of creativity to brainstrom ideas and innovate the game. Whether its making a new concept as a whole<br>
            or changing already made concepts and giving new ways to make something easier to use or making something better.</p>
        <h2>Developing Alone Can Be Difficult</h2>
        <p>Teamwork and the ability to get along with others are both  extremely needed skill in the development industry.<br>
        This is because of the amount of different positions and specialties that are needed to get a game from the development<br>
        to the sales stage and further on.<br>
        You also need to have a passion for what you do or else you games are bound to fail. If something is made without a<br>
        a drive or passion to make it the best it can be according to the creator's idea it is subject to becoming severly<br>
        less than what was intended.</p>
        
        <h2>Handling Problems On The Inside</h2>

        <p>Prgramming is one of the bigger things on the inside of development that needs a pretty big team. There is a lot of<br>
        programming involved when it comes to game development so people need bigger teams to help progress faster and help to organize<br>
        and problem solve when bugs come up.<br>
        Along with that comes the skill of good time management. Time management is a huge thing especially if you are developing<br>
        for a big company that has to meet certain deadlines for their investors.</p>
