        <h2>The Process Of Game Making</h2>
        <p>The process of making video games is mainly split into 7 parts. Planning, Pre-Production, Production,<br>
        Testing, Pre-Launch, Launch, Post-Launch. There are a lot of things that developers must ask themselves<br>
        and think about when it comes to game development. A lot of these are what-if questions and soley depend<br>
        on how the game is recieved by the public and how well the game will sell. Here are some of the things that <br>
        happen and some of the questions asked in each stage of development.</p>
